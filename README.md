# docker-rsync

docker-rsync recursively watches directories for changes and copies
changes via rsync. It is a drop in replacement for the 
existing boot2docker vboxsf feature.

Please note though that syncing happens only in one direction. 
If you want to sync back from a Docker container to your local machine, 
docker-rsync is not the tool you're looking for. 

__Is it fast?__ Yes! While the initial sync might take some seconds
(depending on the number of files you want to sync), following syncs are 
super fast (compared to vboxsf & NFS). A one file sync usually takes less than 100ms.

docker-rsync relies on [FSEvents API](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/FSEvents_Ref/), 
so this tool will only work under Mac OSX.


## Installation

```bash
brew tap synack/docker
brew install docker-rsync
```


## Usage with docker-machine

```bash
brew install docker-machine
docker-machine create my-machine123 -d virtualbox

cd sync-this-directory
echo ".git" >> .rsyncignore

docker-rsync my-machine123
```


## Talk to rsync directly

```bash
cd sync-this-directory
echo ".git" >> .rsyncignore

docker-rsync rsync://<IP:PORT>/<MODULE>
